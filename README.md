### Hi, I'm Michael 👋

I'm a Design Lead with a passion for creating user-centred, accessible design. I'm proficient with JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and I have also been dabbling with frameworks such as React and NextJS. I've conducted research and design work in UX/UI, including mid-to-high fidelity prototyping with Axure and Figma, and more recently in Service Design.

### My Journey in Tech

I was as a Digital Content Editor where I created and edited web content before eventually getting into web design and development, which then led to me getting involved in UX. I now work as a Design Lead at Citizens Advice where I've helped design design sites, web apps, and services.
