### The Switch into Tech

I now work for the public sector as a Designer at Made Tech, but I previoulsy worked in Academic Publishing. I made the career switch into tech so I could learn more about the technology behind the types of software I was using on a daily basis in both my professional and personal life. It started as a hobby and has since become a professional interest â€“ driven by my passion for augmenting user experience.
