I'm a User Researcher & UX Engineer with an aptitude for user-oriented, accessible design. My current engineering stack is JavaScript, React, CSS, HTML, and I have also been dabbling with NextJS. For my research and design/prototyping work, I'm mostly using Figma, Miro and Webflow.

### The Switch into Tech

I prevoulsy worked in Academic Publishing and made the career switch into tech so I could learn more about the technology behind the types of software I was using on a daily basis in both my professional and personal life. It started as a hobby and has since become a professional interest â€“ driven by my passion for augmenting the user experience. You can find links to some of the projects I've worked on â€“ both independently and as a team â€“ below this section.
