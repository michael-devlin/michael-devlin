### Hi there 👋

I'm Michael – a Software Developer with a penchant for Frontend design/UX. I'm a former Publishing Editor with a background in teaching English, and I hold an MA (Distinction) in Applied Ethics. My current working stack is JavaScript, React, CSS, HTML, and I also have some experience with Postgres (SQL) and Node. I made the career switch into tech so I could learn more about the technology behind the types of software I was using on a daily basis in Publishing, as well as in my personal life. It started as a hobby and has since become a professional interest. You can find links to some of the projects I've worked on independently and as a team below this section.
