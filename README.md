### The Switch into Tech

I previoulsy worked in Academic Publishing and made the career switch into tech so I could learn more about the technology behind the types of software I was using on a daily basis in both my professional and personal life. It started as a hobby and has since become a professional interest – driven by my passion for augmenting the user experience. You can find links to some of the projects I've worked on – both independently and as a team – below this section.
