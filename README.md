I'm a Design Lead with a passion for creating user-centred, accessible design. I'm proficient with JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and I have also been dabbling with frameworks such as React and NextJS. I've conducted research and design work in UX/UI, including mid-to-high fidelity prototyping with Axure and Figma, and more recently in Service Design.
